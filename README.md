# Car-Block-Box
Black Boxes are typically used in any transportation system (ex: Airplanes) that are used for analysis post-crash and understand the root cause of accidents. Continuous monitoring and logging of events (ex: over-speeding) is critical for effective usage of black box. The goal of this project is to implement core functionalities of a care black-box in a PIC based micro-controller supported by rich peripherals. Events will be logged in EEPROM in this project. This project can be further extended to any vehicle.
